## Overview

We're trying to make self-sustainable web app for local farms.

Our goal is to (a) make our web app as self-sustainable as possible -- i.e. zero maintenance cost if possible by using free API's (Google Sheets API and Google Forms API), and (b) design the web app specifically for local producers' use cases: UI suitable for field use.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Prerequisites
git clone https://github.com/soobinrho/good-life-farms.git
cd good-life-farms
pnpm install

# How to run a development server
pnpm dev
```
