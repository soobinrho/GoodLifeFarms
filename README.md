## Overview

We're trying to make a self-sustainable selling platform for all local producers who need one.

Our goal is to (a) make our web app as self-sustainable as possible -- i.e. zero maintenance cost by using free API's (Google Sheets API and Google Forms API), and (b) specifically implement the design such that it's easy for local producers to use in the field.
