## Overview

We're trying to make a self-sustainable selling platform for all local producers who need one.

Our goal is to (a) make our web app as self-sustainable as possible -- i.e. zero maintenance cost by using free API's offered by big technology companies, and (b) specifically to implement the design such that it's easy for local producers to use in the field.

In fact, we achieved this by using Google Sheets as our user interface.
If you're a local producer, we will give you a Google Sheet that you can use freely to manage your inventory.
Whatever you enter in the inventory will be reflected on https://GoodLifeFarms.nsustain.com in real time.
All your local consumers will be able to see your real-time inventory and make an order accordingly.
