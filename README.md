## Overview

We're trying to make self-sustainable web apps for local farms.

> “Learning how to grow vegetables efficiently on a large scale is only one part of sustaining local food production.
> Often, that is the part of the job that farmers enjoy and have expertise in—but they may not know how to market their crops to consumers ...
> Spending time doing marketing is expensive and time consuming.
> It is hard to tell a lot of people at once what you have on FB and have them order." (Dr. G from Augustana University)

One of our bio professor (Dr. G) needs a web app for her farm, which she operates with her husband in Canton, South Dakota.
This is the prototype of our web app.
This was made specifically for Good Life Farms, but we hope to make it deployable by anyone who needs it, whether it be seniors, college students, or SWE's trying to have their own farm.

Our goal is to (a) make our web app as self-sustainable as possible -- i.e. zero maintenance cost if possible by using free API's (Google Sheets API and Google Forms API), and (b) design the web app specifically for local farmers' use cases: UI suitable for field use for farmers.
