## Who are we?

We (Soobin, Tobi, Kathy) met at TreeHacks 2024 and joined hands with the intention to not only challenge ourselves but also to utilize this opportunity to make a real-life impact.

Soobin's biology professor at Augustana University, Dr. G, needs a web app for Good Life Farms, a vegetable farm in Canton, South Dakota.
The idea came from the need for a medium connecting local producers (farmers, beekeepers, and so on) with local families.
According to Dr. G, local farmers try using existing technology - such as Facebook Marketplace - but these current existing technologies are not very ideal for their use cases because using them requires too much time on marketing and finding customers.

Instead, what they need is an app (ideally in the form of an IOS / Android app, but we're making it as a web app for prototyping purposes), an app that can help them not spend any more time marketing and instead spend time caring for their farms, gardens, beehives, and so on.
Also, they need an app whose UI is suitable to use right at the field -- it's not ideal if they have to come back indoors and sit down in front of a computer whenever they need to update their stock information.

In addition, Dr. G wants this app to not only help local producers connect with neighboring household customers, but also connect with restaurants.
As it turns out, preparing packages for bulk orders tend to be simpler, in contrast to individual orders, which require more packaging and therefore more time.
