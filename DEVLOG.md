## What we are not

We are not a marketplace app like Ebay or Amazon.
We make a single web page for each local producer with the aim of making it as self-sustainable and low-maintenance as possible.

We avoid fancy, expensive technology at all costs, and in fact, we provide our volunteering service for free for all local producers.
To achieve this, we didn't use any dedicated database or cloud infrastructure services to build our web app because they're expensive to maintain.
Instead, our web app is built solely using free services provided by Google (Sheets, Forms, etc).
Thus, it's free for us to maintain Good Life Farms aside from hosting our server, and therefore, we don't have to charge any of our users.

## What we can do for you

We are volunteers who love the environment and sustainability, and we believe helping local producers and local consumers thrive is one of the best ways we can be environmentally sustainable.
We work on this on our free time, so we can't guarentee a timeline, but we promise to complete you request you submit here.

After you submit this form to us, we will create a page with a url such as this: https://GoodLifeFarms.nsustain.com/prototype
The word "prototype" will be replaced with your desired display name you submit.

We will then send you an invite to your own Google Sheets.
This is how you'll be able to edit what's going to be shown on your page that we will have created for you.
There, you have an option to enter the name of the item(s), their price, and their description.
Whatever you enter there, it will be shown to your new Good Life Farms page in real time.
Since we built our web app entirely using free services, the data update might sometimes be sluggish.
In that case, please refresh your page, and it will most likely work again.

Also, it's up to you, the local producer, to decide on the payment and delivery logistics.
We will not implement a payment processor (PayPal, Stripe, etc) on our web app because that requires us to take constant care of transactions and sensitive user data, which means our project won't be low-maintenance anymore.

You can then share your web page with your fellow local consumers.
They'll be able to see exactly the same things you see on your screen, including the name, price, and description of each item you entered on your Google Sheets.
They'll be able to make an order through your web page by clicking the order buttons.

## Who are we?

We are Kathy, Tobi, and Soobin.
We met at Stanford TreeHacks, in which we created self-sustainable web app for local producers (farmers, beekeepers, and so on).

Right now, our website just shows a prototype, but in the far future hopefully, we envision to have a "create your own web app for your local farm" button which can create this web app for any local producers who needs their own web app to sell their produces -- a dedicated, low-maintenance platform for each and every local producer who needs one.
We envision to be Vercel for local producers -- providing a completely free service to anyone who needs it, and if you need millions or billions of rows of data that cannot be handled effectively by our existing, free Google Sheets back-end infrastructure, then you can migrate to proprietary services like Shopify.

Our main aim is

- (a) to make it as self-sustainable as possible by making it zero-maintenance cost (we did it by getting rid of databases and just using Google Sheets API's which are completely free) so that the local producers don't have to pay a dime in order to have their own dedicated platform, and
- (b) to make it as UI/UX friendly as possible so that they can use it in the field without having to come back indoors and sit in front of their computers. We built it such that basically we give you an access to Google Sheets document, and whatever you edit there (name of the produce and quantity and notes) gets automatically listed on the web app. So, the only thing the farmer has to do is just type in whatever they have (name / quantity / notes) on a Google Sheet!

***Insert original orange puppy and tomato cat here***

These logos were created by our Lead Designer Norianne Batoon, whom I met in the Graphics Design class in my last semester of college (Fall, 2024).
The moment I saw her design (we just had learned how to use Adobe Illustrator and we were going around in turn presenting our designs), I knew I had to recruit her to be our lead designer because (a) Dr. G has a lot of farm cats, so I tried making a cat logo but could not because making a logo is too difficult for me, and (b) Norianne's design consists of cats and puppies; and veggie and fruit at the same time, which are exactly the two things that Good Life Farms needs as a logo.

***Insert the final version of the logo here***

This is the final version of the logo she created with the help of Professor Izia Lindsay.
