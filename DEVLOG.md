### Procedures for Adding a New Local Producer

```bash
# TODO: Document procedures with local producers.
# It will be nice to have as much of this automated as possible.
# Maybe, start as a bash script and scale up?
cd GoodLifeFarms/src
cp components/... ...

# TODO: Delete this comment once documentation is complete.
# For real local producers page, top center = local producer name.
# Edit in Sheets is needed only in the prototype page.
```
